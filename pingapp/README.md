## The Goal
The goal of this app is to create a task app that doesn't overwhelm you with complexity, but gives you all the right tools to achieve your goals.

## A Case for the Features
It's difficult to find the right tool for the right application. I have found that most of the tools that are available either are too simple, and only encompass the features of a general checklist, or delve way too deep into the world of project management. PingMe aims to shoot right down the middle between these two schools of thought.

## My Personal Struggles with the Available Technology
I am always missing notifications, even if they are toggled to high priority. Sometimes it's hard for me to decide whether to add a task to my reminders app, or to set an alarm for it so I absolutley can't miss it. PingMe is designed with the concept of combining the utility of a task list and the incessance of an alarm. PingMe gives you the option to set notifications to alert you in consecutive intervals based on the priority of the task.

## What Every Good Task List Needs (Without Going Overboard:P)

- Prioritization
- Deadlines
- Reminders
    - PingMe is unique in the way it notifies the user. Once a reminder triggers, it will play a sound. The app will continue to sound every x minutes based on the level of priority.
- Re-useable Tasks
- Subtasks
    - Sometimes it's better to organize tasks into subtask. This help break down large projects into simple tasks in order to achieve your goals.
- Attach files
- Attach notes
